Welcome to the Fappy Bird game! This project is my own clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, built using C++ and the SFML library. This is my first real project using the SFML library.

## Introduction

Fappy Bird is a simple yet addictive game where you control a bird to navigate through obstacles (pipes) without crashing.

## Features

- Smooth and responsive gameplay
- Randomly generated pipes
- Collision detection with pipes and ground
- Sound effects for jumps, points, and collisions
- Scalable background and bird textures

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fappybird.git
cd fappybird
```

2. Ensure you have SFML installed on your system. You can download SFML from [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).

3. Build the project using your preferred method. If you're using CMake, follow these steps:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## How to Play

- Press the spacebar or left mouse button to make the bird fly.
- Navigate through the pipes without hitting them or the ground.
- Enjoy the game and try to beat your high score!

## Building the Project

The project uses CMake to manage the build process. Below is the provided `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.28)
project(FappyBird LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/bin)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(SFML
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/SFML/SFML.git
        GIT_TAG 3.0.0
        GIT_SHALLOW ON
        EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
        SYSTEM)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(SFML)

add_executable(main
        src/main.cpp
        src/icon.h
        src/background.h
        src/FappyBird.h
        src/Pipe.h
        src/soundEffects.h
        src/fappyBirdGame.h
)

target_compile_features(main PRIVATE cxx_std_17)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE SFML::Graphics SFML::Window SFML::System SFML::Audio)

set_target_properties(main PROPERTIES
        VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/relative/path/to/working/directory"
)
```

### Explanation

- **Project Setup:** The `CMakeLists.txt` file sets the minimum required version of CMake to 3.28 and defines the project name as "FappyBird" using C++.
- **Output Directory:** The `CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` is set to output all binaries to the `bin` directory within the build directory.
- **Fetching SFML:** The `FetchContent` module is used to fetch and configure the SFML library from its GitHub repository. The specific version fetched is 3.0.0.
- **Executable and Source Files:** The `add_executable` command creates an executable named `main` and includes all necessary source and header files for the project.
- **Compiler Features:** The project is set to use the C++17 standard.
- **Linking Libraries:** The `target_link_libraries` command links the executable with the SFML libraries for graphics, window management, system functionality, and audio.
- **Set Target Properties:** The `set_target_properties` sets the working directory to a relative path.

### Building Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fappybird.git
   cd fappybird
   ```

2. **Create a Build Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. **Configure the Project:**
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

4. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```

This will compile the game and place the executable in the `bin` directory.
